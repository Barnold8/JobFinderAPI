# Job finder API

# What is it?

The job finder API is a mechanism to provide ease of use in regards to finding jobs programmatically. This repository is aimed at applications that wish to query multiple job websites for, well, jobs! An example in mind would be an application that allows a user to pick job websites from a checklist, provide their location and then the role they wish to embark upon. After this, on their end theyll get a whole massive list of jobs, but behind the scenes, this API will scrape job websites with specific paramitized data that the user gave.
